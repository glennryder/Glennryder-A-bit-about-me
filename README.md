I recently graduated from Pace University with a Bachelor's degree in Communications, I am currently nearing the completion of my graduate degree in Business Intelligence Analytics, with the program concluding in October. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis, communication, and problem-solving, essential for navigating the complex landscape of technology and business.

Throughout my studies and internships in marketing and sales, I have worked on numerous projects where I honed my skills in SQL, Tableau, Python, Power BI, and Microsoft Office. These experiences have provided me with hands-on expertise in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, allowing me to uncover valuable insights and support data-driven decision-making.

As I transition into the tech industry, I am eager to leverage my analytical skills and technical knowledge to contribute to innovative solutions and drive success in a dynamic environment. My goal is to continue expanding my expertise while making a meaningful impact in the field of technology.

Some facts about me:
I am a dual-citizen (Irish and American)
I live in NYC, but am open to relocation
Sports fanatic, but also enjoy cooking and travelling. 
My goal for the end of 2024 is to land a job in a company where I can express myself and grow.
